Space computers are affected by radiation, and it requires regular human checkup.
But humans themselves are affected by radiation. Why there are no injuries by cosmic radiation?
## Solution
Make cosmic computers fully analog. Like a neural computers. With self-healing mechanisms like training in real-time.
All calculations must be done by non-digital hardware, including measuring, radio communication, and re-training (former reprogramming).
