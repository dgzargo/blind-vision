## Lack of context
Human mind is made differently: a person themself is the context. But AIs have almost no context. The context is too small, so they start to invent a context. The story in the chat itself is their context as well.
## Random fact check
There is a way to simplify fact checking mechanism: do a fact check of small random detail, instead of fact check of the whole text.
The way it should work:
1) Generate an answer
2) Fact check of small random detail
3) Correct the answer if needed
4) Memorize the answer
After lot of iterations, all mistakes will be corrected.
### An example of a fact check
1) When a character says about 3rd character, one can ask for check for its gender. (Which pronoun to use: he or she.)
2) When a character uses a thing, fact checks will be "does the character have THE THING?", "Does they (the character) knows about that that they have THE THING?", etc.
